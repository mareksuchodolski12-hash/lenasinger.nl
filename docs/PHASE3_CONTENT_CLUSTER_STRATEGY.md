## INTERNAL LINKING STRATEGY

### Hub → Spoke Linking

**Every blog article must:**

1. Link to 1–2 hub pages (wedding services OR corporate services)
2. Link to 3–5 related articles (internal cross-linking)
3. Link to 2–3 relevant city pages (geo-contextual)

**Example internal linking pattern:**

```
Article: "5 Things to Consider When Booking a Wedding Singer"
├── Link to: Wedding Singer Services (hub)
├── Related articles:
│   ├── "Wedding Ceremony Music Ideas"
│   ├── "How Much Does a Wedding Vocalist Cost?"
│   └── "Best Time to Book"
└── City pages:
    ├── "Wedding Singer in Eindhoven"
    ├── "Wedding Singer in Veldhoven"
```

### Spoke → Hub Linking

**Every hub page (services) must link to:**

1. 5–10 relevant blog articles (contextual, supporting)
2. All higher-priority city pages (geographic)

**Example:**

```
Wedding Services Hub
├── Featured Blog Articles:
│   ├── "Wedding Ceremony Music Ideas"
│   ├── "How Much Does a Vocalist Cost?"
│   └── "Best Time to Book"
├── City Pages (top tier):
│   ├── Eindhoven
│   ├── Veldhoven
│   └── [6 others]
```
