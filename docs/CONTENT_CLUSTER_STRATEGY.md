# CONTENT CLUSTER STRATEGY

## 1. STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK: PILLAR → CLUSTER → SUPPORTING CONTENT

### The Problem with Random Blog Posts:

Most service businesses blog randomly ("5 First Dance Songs" one week, "How to Survive Wedding Planning" the next). Google doesn't see the connection. Low authority, scattered keywords, minimal SEO impact.

### The Solution: Pillar Page + Content Clusters

**Pillar Page** = Comprehensive hub on ONE topic (2,500-3,500 words)

- Covers topic broadly
- Targets main keyword
- Links to all supporting content
- Example: "Wedding Photography Timeline: Guide for Couples"

**Content Cluster** = 4-8 supporting blog posts (1,000-1,500 words each)

- Dive deep into subtopics
- Target long-tail variations
- Link back to pillar
- Example: "Getting Ready Timeline," "Ceremony Timeline," "Reception Timeline"

**Authority Result:**
Google sees pillar + cluster as comprehensive coverage of topic → ranks better for main keyword + all related keywords.
