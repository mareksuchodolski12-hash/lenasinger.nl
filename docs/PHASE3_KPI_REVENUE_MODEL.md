**Investment:** €25,000 (development + content setup)

**Payback timeline:**

```
Month 1: €5,000 revenue - €25,000 investment = -€20,000 (not yet)
Month 2: €9,500 revenue cumulative = -€15,500 (not yet)
Month 3: €22,500 revenue cumulative = -€2,500 (almost!)
Month 4: €40,000 revenue cumulative = +€15,000 (BREAK-EVEN in Month 3.8)
```

**Break-even:** ~3.8 months (mid-Month 4)
**Payback period:** Acceptable (most businesses target 6–12 months)

---

## SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

### What If Conversion Rate is 10% (vs. 20% assumed)?

```
Leads: 80–100 → 8–10 qualified leads/month (vs. 16–20)
Bookings: 1.6–2 (vs. 3–4)
Month 3 Revenue: €6,000–€8,000 (vs. €12–17K)

IMPACT: Delayed break-even, need to boost traffic 2x OR improve messaging/sales
```

**Response:** Increase blog content, paid advertising, improve lead scoring

### What If Organic Traffic is 50% Lower?

```
Leads: 40–50/month (vs. 80–100)
Qualified: 8–10 (vs. 16–20)
Bookings: 1.6–2/month (vs. 3–4)

IMPACT: Significant revenue delay, need alternative traffic source
```

**Response:** Implement paid search advertising, increase content production, improve local partnerships

### What If Average Booking Value is €3,500 (vs. €4,000+)?

```
Monthly revenue drops ~12% across board
Year 1: ~€280,000 → ~€245,000

IMPACT: Minimal (still profitable, just slower growth)
```

**Response:** Improve upselling, position Premium tier more aggressively, target higher-budget couples

---

## REVENUE OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES

### Tier 2: Increase Average Booking Value

**Current mix:** 50% Essential/Premium, 50% Premium/Signature

**Potential additional revenue:** €50,000–€100,000/year

### Tier 4: Expand Geographic Scope

**Potential additional revenue:** €300,000–€500,000/year (new markets, less competition in smaller cities)
