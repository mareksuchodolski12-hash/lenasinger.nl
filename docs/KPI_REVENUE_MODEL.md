# KPI & REVENUE MODEL DASHBOARD

## 1. STRATEGIC OVERVIEW: MEASURING LOCAL MARKET DOMINATION

### Why KPIs Matter:

Without measurement, you're flying blind. You don't know:

- Which strategies are working (or wasting time)
- What revenue to expect (impossible to plan)
- When to scale (or cut back)
- How leads become dollars (attribution mystery)
- Which marketing channels actually work (waste 50% of budget)

### Our Dashboard Approach:

**3 Levels of Metrics:**

1. **Top-Line Metrics** (overall business health)
2. **Conversion Funnel Metrics** (where people drop off)
3. **Segment-Specific Metrics** (wedding vs. corporate vs. coaching)

Each metric has:

- **Current State** (baseline)
- **Target** (3-month, 6-month, 12-month)
- **Action Plan** (how to improve)

---

## 2. TOP-LINE REVENUE METRICS

### Annual Revenue Projection (Year 1)

**Baseline Assumption:**
You're starting Phase 3 with existing website. Let's assume:

- Current annual revenue: $30,000 (part-time, no real optimization)
- Current annual leads: 24 (2/month)
- Current close rate: 40% (good, but unqualified leads)

**Phase 3 Projection (12-Month Outlook):**

| Month | Leads/Month | Close Rate | Avg. Revenue/Booking | Monthly Revenue | Running Total |
| ----- | ----------- | ---------- | -------------------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| Jan   | 2           | 40%        | $1,200               | $960            | $960          |
| Feb   | 3           | 42%        | $1,350               | $1,701          | $2,661        |
| Mar   | 5           | 45%        | $1,500               | $3,375          | $6,036        |

| May   | 12          | 50%        | $1,950               | $11,700         | $24,264       |
| Jun   | 15          | 52%        | $2,100               | $16,380         | $40,644       |
| Jul   | 18          | 52%        | $2,150               | $19,908         | $60,552       |
| Aug   | 18          | 52%        | $2,150               | $19,908         | $80,460       |
| Sep   | 20          | 53%        | $2,200               | $23,320         | $103,780      |
| Oct   | 22          | 53%        | $2,250               | $26,235         | $130,015      |
| Nov   | 18          | 52%        | $2,100               | $19,656         | $149,671      |
| Dec   | 20          | 52%        | $2,500               | $26,000         | $175,671      |

**Year 1 Projection: $175,671 annual revenue**

- **Increase vs. baseline: 485% ($145,671 net new revenue)**
- **This assumes:** Progressive gains from positioning, pricing, local SEO, content, and lead qualification
- **Reality weight:** Achievable with consistent execution (months 1-3 slow, months 4-8 rapid growth, months 9-12 sustainable peak)

### Awareness Metrics (Top of Funnel)

**Metric 1: Monthly Website Visitors**

| Timeframe        | Current | 3-Month Target | 6-Month Target | 12-Month Target |
| ---------------- | ------- | -------------- | -------------- | :-------------- |
| Monthly Visitors | 500     | 1,200          | 2,500          | 5,000+          |
| Unique Visitors  | 400     | 900            | 1,800          | 3,500+          |
| Session Duration | 1:30    | 2:00           | 2:15           | 2:30+           |
| Pages/Session    | 2.5     | 3.2            | 3.5            | 4.0+            |
| Bounce Rate      | 55%     | 45%            | 40%            | 35%             |

**Key Points:**

- Visitors come from: Organic search (60%), Direct (20%), Social (10%), Referral (10%)
- By month 6, local SEO should drive 60%+ of traffic (up from 20% current)
- Content cluster + local SEO powers the growth

**Action Plan (to hit targets):**

- Months 1-2: Implement local SEO city pages (Franklin, Brentwood first)
- Months 3-4: Publish first 6 blog posts (wedding cluster)
- Months 5-6: Complete 16-post content calendar launch
- Ongoing: Guest posting, local directory mentions, social media

**Tool:** Google Analytics 4 (free)

---

**Metric 2: Organic Search Traffic**

| Timeframe                | Current | 3-Mo | 6-Mo  | 12-Mo  |
| ------------------------ | ------- | ---- | ----- | ------ |
| Organic Sessions         | 300     | 600  | 1,500 | 3,000+ |
| Keywords Ranking         | 15      | 40   | 80    | 150+   |
| Keywords Top 10          | 2       | 8    | 25    | 50+    |
| Click-Through Rate (CTR) | 2%      | 2.5% | 3.0%  | 3.5%   |

**Why This Matters:**

- Organic traffic is FREE and sustainable
- 1,500 organic sessions/month = $15K+/month revenue potential
- Local SEO city pages + content clusters drive this growth

**Action Plan:**

- Implement cities.json (weeks 1-2)
- Launch top-tier city pages (weeks 3-4)
- Add supporting cities progressively (months 2-3)
- Blog publishing schedule (months 2-6)
- Monitor rankings weekly, optimize underperforming pages monthly

**Tool:** Google Search Console (free) + Ahrefs/Semrush paid tier

---

**Metric 3: Social Media Reach**

| Channel                       | Current | 3-Mo  | 6-Mo  | 12-Mo   |
| ----------------------------- | ------- | ----- | ----- | ------- |
| Instagram Followers           | 200     | 500   | 1,200 | 2,500+  |
| Instagram Monthly Impressions | 1,000   | 3,000 | 7,000 | 15,000+ |
| Facebook Followers            | 150     | 300   | 700   | 1,500+  |
| TikTok Followers              | 0       | 100   | 500   | 2,000+  |

**Why This Matters:**

- Social builds brand awareness (couples research you on Instagram)
- Instagram + TikTok = younger audience (Gen Z, younger millennials)
- Builds social proof (testimonials, event clips, behind-the-scenes)

**Action Plan:**

- Post 3x/week (Instagram reels, TikTok content)
- Feature: Client success stories, singing tips, event recap videos
- Hashtag strategy (#VocalCoach #WeddingSinger #[City])
- Post blog launches to social (drive traffic)

**Tool:** Buffer (scheduling), Later (planning)

---

### Qualification Metrics (Middle Funnel)

**Metric 4: Form Submissions**

| Timeframe                    | Current | 3-Mo | 6-Mo | 12-Mo |
| ---------------------------- | ------- | ---- | ---- | ----- |
| Monthly Form Submissions     | 4       | 12   | 30   | 60+   |
| Form Completion Rate         | 60%     | 70%  | 75%  | 80%+  |
| Avg. Form Submission/Visitor | 0.8%    | 1.5% | 1.8% | 2.0%+ |

**Why This Matters:**

- Form submissions = interested leads
- Multi-step form should improve completion (vs. single-page form)
- Budget pre-qualification filters out tire-kickers

**Action Plan:**

- Deploy multi-step form (month 1)
- Test form copy for clarity (month 2)
- A/B test CTA button placement (month 3)
- Optimize for mobile (if not already)

**Tool:** Form platform (Formspree, Tally) + heatmap software (Hotjar)

---

**Metric 5: Lead Scoring & Quality**

| Timeframe                                  | Current | 3-Mo | 6-Mo | 12-Mo |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------- | ---- | ---- | ----- |
| High-Quality Leads/Month (scoring 80+)     | 1       | 6    | 15   | 30+   |
| Medium-Quality Leads/Month (scoring 60-79) | 2       | 4    | 12   | 25+   |
| Low-Quality Leads/Month (scoring <60)      | 1       | 2    | 3    | 5+    |
| Avg. Lead Score                            | 55      | 70   | 78   | 85+   |

**Lead Scoring Matrix:**
High-quality lead (80+):

- Event: Wedding
- Date: 60-180 days out (optimal booking window)
- Location: Within 20 km
- Budget: $2,000+ (core tier or premium)
- Guest count: 75-200 (standard wedding size)

Medium-quality lead (60-79):

- Event: Any type
- Date: 30-60 days OR 6+ months
- Location: Within 40 km
- Budget: $1,000-2,000 OR $2,000-3,000
- Guest count: Any

Low-quality lead (<60):

- Budget: <$1,000
- Date: Way out (12+ months) OR urgent (14 days)
- Location: >40 km away
- Explicit budget concerns ("Need budget option")

**Action Plan:**

- Tag all form submissions with lead score
- Prioritize high-quality leads for immediate follow-up
- Nurture medium-quality leads (email sequence)
- Auto-respond to low-quality (don't waste time calls)

**Tool:** CRM (HubSpot free tier, or Pipedrive)

---

### Engagement Metrics (Middle-to-Closing)

**Metric 6: Consultation Scheduled**

| Timeframe                | Current | 3-Mo | 6-Mo | 12-Mo |
| ------------------------ | ------- | ---- | ---- | ----- |
| Consultation Calls/Month | 2       | 6    | 18   | 35+   |
| From Form Submissions    | 50%     | 60%  | 65%  | 70%+  |
| Scheduled Within 24hrs   | 40%     | 70%  | 80%  | 90%+  |
| Show-Up Rate             | 70%     | 80%  | 85%  | 90%+  |

**Why This Matters:**

- Form submission ≠ scheduled call (they might not see follow-up email)
- Scheduled call ≠ not-missed call (people forget)
- Effective follow-up = dramatic conversion lift

**Action Plan:**

- Send autoresponder email immediately (within 5 min)
- Include Calendly link (make scheduling easy)
- Send SMS reminder 24hr before call (if have phone)
- If no response to email, call within 4 hours (high-quality leads only)
- Leave professional voicemail + follow-up text

**Tool:** Calendly (booking), Mailchimp or ConvertKit (email automation)

---

**Metric 7: Call-to-Proposal Conversion**

| Timeframe             | Current | 3-Mo | 6-Mo | 12-Mo |
| --------------------- | ------- | ---- | ---- | ----- |
| Proposals Sent/Month  | 1.5     | 4    | 12   | 25+   |
| Calls → Proposal Rate | 65%     | 70%  | 75%  | 80%+  |

**Why This Matters:**

- Not every call leads to proposal (some disqualify themselves)
- Proposal = serious interest (they're considering paying)
- Needs qualification: Budget, date, fit

**Call Script Strategy:**

1. Build rapport (5 min) — "Tell me about your event"
2. Listen (10 min) — Understand their needs, budget, vision
3. Qualify (5 min) — "This sounds like [Tier 2/3/4] package"
4. Set expectation (2 min) — "I'll email proposal by tomorrow"
5. Close (2 min) — "Looking forward to working together!"

**Action Plan:**

- Script consultations (consistency)
- Train on tier-matching (right package recommendation)
- Send proposal same day or next morning (momentum)
- 3-day follow-up if no response

**Tool:** Call recording (Google Voice), CRM tracking

---

### Closing Metrics (Bottom Funnel)

**Metric 8: Proposal-to-Booking Conversion**

| Timeframe                    | Current | 3-Mo | 6-Mo | 12-Mo |
| ---------------------------- | ------- | ---- | ---- | ----- |
| Bookings/Month               | 1.0     | 2.8  | 8.4  | 18+   |
| Proposals → Booking Rate     | 80%     | 80%  | 85%  | 85%+  |
| Days from Proposal → Booking | 7       | 5    | 4    | 3     |

**Why This Matters:**

- Final conversion before revenue is recognized
- Proposal quality matters (wrong package = rejection)
- Urgency matters (send proposal fast, follow up immediately)

**Proposal Strategy:**

- Include pricing (3 tiers to choose from)
- Include testimonial (social proof)
- Explain what's included
- Show cancellation policy
- Include booking link (make it easy)
- Follow up at day 3 and day 5 if not booked

**Action Plan:**

- Standardize proposal template (professional, on-brand)
- Include tier options (gives choice, feel of control)
- Add urgency (limited dates available by [DATE])
- Follow up relentlessly (email day 3, phone day 5)

**Tool:** Proposal software (PandaDoc) or PDF template

---

**Metric 9: Average Revenue Per Booking**

| Timeframe                  | Current | 3-Mo   | 6-Mo   | 12-Mo   |
| -------------------------- | ------- | ------ | ------ | ------- |
| Avg. Revenue/Booking       | $1,200  | $1,400 | $1,700 | $2,100+ |
| Coaching Sessions (Tier 1) | 20%     | 15%    | 15%    | 10%     |
| Boutique Services (Tier 2) | 15%     | 15%    | 20%    | 20%     |
| Premium Events (Tier 3)    | 60%     | 65%    | 60%    | 60%     |
| Signature Luxury (Tier 4)  | 5%      | 5%     | 5%     | 10%     |

**Why This Matters:**

- "Bookings" is misleading metric (3 coaching sessions ≠ 1 wedding)
- Revenue per booking shows if you're moving upmarket
- Tier 3 & 4 are most profitable (60% + services)
- Goal: Shift mix toward premium (avoid discount race)

**Action Plan:**

- Train on upsell language (during consultation)
- Position coaching as gateway (upgrade path to events)
- Show tier packages (3-option rule)
- Create scarcity ("Limited Tier 4 slots in 2026")

**Tool:** Financial tracking (QuickBooks, Wave)

| Corporate Revenue/Month   | $240    | $3,600       | 15x growth            |

**Action Plan:**

- Target corporate planners (not wedding couples)
- Emphasize reliability + professionalism
- Show corporate testimonials (not wedding ones)
- Offer multi-event discounts (3+ events/year = 15% off)

| Coaching Revenue/Month         | $33     | $360+        | 10x growth            |

**Why Coaching Matters:**

- Entry point (lowest commitment)
- Builds trust (ongoing relationship)
- Upsell path ($67/hr → $795 program → $2,995 event)
- Recurring revenue (predictable)

**Action Plan:**

- Advertise coaching as "start here" (beginner-friendly)
- Free consultation to reduce friction
- Create coaching package tiers (4/8/12 weeks)

## 5. FINANCIAL METRICS

### Revenue Breakdown (Monthly at Scale)

**By Segment:**

```
Wedding:           $9,500    (54% of revenue)
Corporate:         $3,600    (20% of revenue)
Coaching:          $3,600    (20% of revenue)
Other/Services:    $1,200    (6% of revenue)
─────────────────────────────
TOTAL:            $17,900   (monthly, or ~$215K annual run rate)
```

**By Tier (Price-Based):**

```
Tier 1 (Coaching):      $3,600  (20% of revenue)
Tier 2 (Boutique):      $2,700  (15% of revenue)
Tier 3 (Premium):      $10,700  (60% of revenue) ← PRIORITY

─────────────────────────────
TOTAL:                $17,900
```

**Key Insight:** 60% of revenue should come from Tier 3 (Premium Events). If skewed toward Tier 1/2, you're trading time for dollars (not scalable).

---

**Why Multi-City Ranking Matters:**

- 1 city page ranking = 20-30 organic visitors/month
- 30 city pages ranking = 600-900 organic visitors/month
- 600 monthly visitors × 2% form submission = 12 leads/month
- 12 leads × 50% close rate = 6 bookings/month

**Action Plan:**

- Month 1: Launch top-5 city pages (Nashville, Franklin, Brentwood, etc.)
- Month 2: Add content, internal linking, social mentions (boost rankings)
- Month 3: Launch next 10 cities (medium tier)
- Month 6: Evaluate Tier 2 city performance, optimize underperformers
- Month 9: Expand to all 30-40 cities
- Ongoing: Monthly optimization, content freshness, link building

**Tool:** Google Search Console (free), Ahrefs/Semrush (keyword tracking)
