# PRICING STRATEGY FRAMEWORK

## 1. PRICING PSYCHOLOGY FUNDAMENTALS

### The Psychology Behind Our Pricing:

**Anchoring Effect:**

- People make decisions relative to the first number they see
- We lead with "starting from" prices for lower-barrier offerings
- This anchors expectation and makes premium packages seem reasonable by comparison

**Price Justification Logic:**

- Clients don't buy price... they buy value
- Our pricing reflects: experience (200+ events), expertise (professional vocalist), customization (personal attention), reliability (4.9 rating)
- Clear pricing shows confidence (no hidden fees)

**Psychological Price Points:**

- $1,497 feels cheaper than $1,500 (charm pricing)
- $3,995 feels cheaper than $4,000 (charm pricing)
- "$Starting from $1,200" anchors low, making premium seem reasonable
- Annual commitment discounts signal long-term value
