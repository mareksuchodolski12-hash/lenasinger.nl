## FAQ (8 Questions)

### 1. DO YOU TRAVEL? WHAT'S THE RADIUS?

**Answer:**  
"Yes, I travel regularly. I'm based in [City], but I've performed at events within 2–4 hours driving distance, and I'm open to longer distances for the right event. Travel costs (fuel, accommodation) can be discussed and added to the quote. For international work, let's talk separately."

---

### 2. WHAT'S YOUR TECHNICAL SETUP? DO I NEED SPECIAL EQUIPMENT?

**Answer:**  
"I'm flexible. I can perform completely acoustic (just a microphone) or with full backing music, piano, or a live band. I have a tech rider (downloadable) with full specs for audio, lighting, and stage setup. Most venues have what I need, but I work with your team to coordinate. No surprises—just collaboration."

---

### 3. CAN WE CUSTOMIZE MY SETLIST? DO YOU TAKE REQUESTS?

**Answer:**  
"Absolutely. We'll discuss your music style, mood, and any special songs you want included. I do originals, covers (across genres), and custom arrangements. The setlist gets finalized 2 weeks before your event so I can prepare fully. If you have a favorite song, I'll do my best to learn it—just ask early."

---

### 4. DO YOU TAKE BREAKS? HOW LONG DO YOU PERFORM?

**Answer:**  
"Yes. For performances over 60 minutes, I typically take a 15-minute break every hour. Total performance time is flexible—30 minutes (cocktail opener) to 120+ minutes (full evening entertainment). We'll figure out what works for your event during our consultation."

---

### 5. WHAT IF I WANT A SPECIAL SONG THAT YOU DON'T USUALLY SING?

**Answer:**  
"Send me the song and I'll learn it. For requests submitted more than 4 weeks before your event, I'll have it performance-ready. Last-minute requests (under 2 weeks) are possible but might require backing music instead of live accompaniment. Let's see what's possible."

---

### 6. WHAT'S THE DEPOSIT & PAYMENT SCHEDULE?

**Answer:**  
"I require a 50% non-refundable deposit to hold your date. Remaining balance due 2 weeks before the event. I accept [payment methods: wire transfer, credit card, PayPal]. Full refund if you cancel more than 30 days out; partial (50%) refund 15–30 days out; non-refundable within 15 days. If you need to reschedule, we'll work with you."

---

### 7. HOW FAR IN ADVANCE SHOULD I BOOK? WHAT IF I NEED THIS SOON?

**Answer:**  
"I book 2–3 months out on average, but I manage a waiting list for last-minute openings. If your date is soon, send an inquiry and we'll see what's possible. The sooner you book, the more time we have to perfect every detail."

---

### 8. HOW DO YOU HANDLE AUDIO/VIDEO RECORDINGS & USAGE RIGHTS?

**Answer:**  
"For performances I'm recording (as part of your package), you get a edited highlight video. You own the rights to use it on your website, social media, and personal archives. If you're recording and want to publish to YouTube or professionally, let's discuss licensing separately. Simple rule: everything's transparent, nothing's sneaky."
