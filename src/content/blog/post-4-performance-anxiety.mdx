# Performance Anxiety: How to Overcome Nervousness Before Singing in Front of an Audience

The spotlight is on you, the music starts, and suddenly your mind goes blank. Your heart races, your palms sweat, and your voice feels shaky. Sound familiar? Performance anxiety is something almost every singer experiences, and the good news is you can overcome it.

## Understanding Performance Anxiety

Performance anxiety isn't weakness—it's your nervous system trying to protect you from perceived danger. Your body releases adrenaline, which can actually work for you if channeled correctly. The key is reframing that nervous energy into positive excitement.

## Pre-Performance Strategies

### 1. Thorough Preparation

Nothing combats anxiety like confidence in your material. Know your lyrics cold, practice your choreography, understand the music arrangement. Over-prepare. When your muscle memory takes over, you have less mental capacity to worry.

### 2. Visualization

Spend 5-10 minutes before your performance visualizing success:

- See the stage clearly
- Feel the microphone in your hand
- Hear the music start
- Imagine the audience responding positively
- Feel the confidence in your voice

This mental rehearsal primes your brain for success.

### 3. Breathing Techniques

Anxiety tightens your breathing. Counteract this with deliberate breathing:

- **4-7-8 breathing**: Inhale for 4 counts, hold for 7, exhale for 8
- **Box breathing**: Inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4
- Repeat 5-10 times until you feel your nervous system calm

This physiologically reduces cortisol and adrenaline.

### 4. Physical Warm-Up

Don't just warm up vocally—move your body:

- Light stretching
- Shake out your hands and shoulders
- Jump around a bit
- Dance

This releases nervous energy productively and gets your blood flowing.

## During the Performance

### Shift Your Focus Outward

Instead of thinking about how you're perceived, focus on _delivering_ the song. Think about:

- The meaning of the lyrics
- Connecting with the audience
- Telling a story
- Sharing joy

This outward focus naturally reduces self-consciousness.

### The Power of the First 10 Seconds

Nervousness peaks at the beginning. If you can get through the opening phrase with confidence, your nervous system realizes you're safe and anxiety quickly drops. This is why thorough preparation matters—let your preparation carry you through those first crucial moments.

### Remember: The Audience Wants You to Succeed

Your audience isn't your enemy. They came _hoping_ you'd be great. They're rooting for you. If you mess up a lyric or have a moment of uncertainty, they won't know or care. They're experiencing the music and your presence, not judging perfection.

## Post-Performance

Acknowledge your courage. Performing publicly takes vulnerability and bravery. Even if it wasn't perfect, you did it. Each performance makes the next one easier.

## The Long-Term Solution

Performance anxiety decreases with experience. The more you perform, the more your nervous system understands that this situation isn't actually dangerous. Build your performance experience through:

- Open mic nights
- Local events
- Community performances
- Workshops with other singers

The fear never completely disappears, but it becomes a manageable energy source rather than an obstacle.
